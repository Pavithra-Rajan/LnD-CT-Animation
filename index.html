										<p>A much-needed elderly advice</p>
										<h2>To Mate Or Not to Mate</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The youngest batch of crowlings had gathered around at sharp 9 AM for yet another learning session. All of them had sharpened their claws ready for drawing the bird’s eye view of objects. However, they were in for a surprise. The elder who had been tasked with educating them decided to start with the usual questioning on arrival. The fledglings sat with trembling wings as they realized that they didn’t remember a single thing from the previous class... </p>

										<h2>CrowTales Ep 7: At the ‘strike’ of midnight hour</h2>
									</header>
									<p>It was the winter of ‘83. A tune far too familiar to the crows had disrupted the tranquillity of the night. It was the signature tune of the announcement system cum college radio. But it was 12 AM. Was an assignment due? Was there a malfunction? Or was it a caw for revolt much like the fall of 1947? The silence for the next few moments was almost deafening as the air... </p>

									<p>NIT Calicut boasts of a 300-acre campus but only you and I know how much of that doesn’t qualify to be a tropical rainforest. NIT Calicut has a horde of highly felicitated faculty but only you and I know who the “good ones” are. The website tells you of all the messes and canteens, but only we know what to get, where and when to get it. Whether C-mess for a good masala dosa or Sumith ettan’s mess for a good... </p>
